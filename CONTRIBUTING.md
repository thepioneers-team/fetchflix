# Contributing to Fetchflix

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Fetchflix. It's people like you that make Fetchflix such a great tool. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Getting Started

Before you begin:

- Ensure you have installed all the necessary dependencies and that the project runs on your local machine.
- Read the documentation, if available, to understand the project's setup and functionality.

### Issues

#### Create a New Issue

If you spot a problem with the project, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new one. Be sure to include:

- A clear title and description
- As much relevant information as possible
- A code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring

#### Solve an Issue

Look through the GitHub issues for projects. Anything tagged with "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
6. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
7. Issue that pull request!

### Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior on the developers websites [skylerx.ir](https://skylerx.ir), [hoseinwave.ir](https://hoseinwave.ir).

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Fetchflix? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript/TypeScript Styleguide

- All JavaScript/TypeScript must adhere to [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

### Documentation Styleguide

- Use Markdown (MD) format.
- Reference your methods and classes in your documentation.
