# Motivation

Many of us have wanted to download a video from the internet. Whether its from YouTube, Instagram, or some other random app. For a while there wasn't a solution but an CLI tool called youtube-dl came out. However, its been a while since its been updated. So a fork of it was made called yt-dlp (thats what we use). But again, its a CLI command not really useable for the normal person. So we decided to make a GUI for the CLI tool to help the average Joe out
