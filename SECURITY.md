## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability within the app, please report it to us. You may do so anonymously, or we can credit you for it if you wish.

The best way to report any vulnerability or security issue is to contact the developers us from their sites [skylerx.ir](https://skylerx.ir), [hoseinwave.ir](https://hoseinwave.ir).
